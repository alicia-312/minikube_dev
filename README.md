## Getting Started

This is a repository for local development on macOS Monterey 12.4. I have built a local minikube cluster and will be walking through step-by-step on how to set up a local environment for a Kubernetes Cluster. 


### Prerequisites

Required: 
  ```sh
brew install docker
brew install minikube
brew install helm
  ```
Nice to Have:
```sh
brew install zsh
brew install vscode
brew install k9s
```
